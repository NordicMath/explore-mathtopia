Tags for quality: nice, top, toptop

Tags for purpose: learn, research.

Tags: Subject areas? Twelve two-letter codes? More detailed?

Collections from various searches, e.g.:
- ArXiv 2016 (explain search terms somewhere?)
- Annals of Mathematics 2001-2005
- ICM 2014
- Seattle 2005

Can I annotate references with blurbs for Torstein?

Tags for specific research projects, maybe with tags like maybe, key, etc, or just reuse nice, top, toptop.
