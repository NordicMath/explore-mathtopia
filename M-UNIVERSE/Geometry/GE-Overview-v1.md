# Great Mountains of Geometry

First draft of list, from north to south:

1. F1-geometry
2. Coleman ridge (p-adic geometry)
3. Algebraic geometry
4. Complex geometry?
5. Differential geometry
6. Hills of Topology
7. Other geometries?
8. Elementary geometries?
9. Noncommutative geometry?

Note that Noncommutative geometry should be places somewhere, close to the Arenas of the Desert.

## F1-geometry

Different flavours of F1-geometry and Arakelov geometry go here.

Visual: Maybe rainbow-coloured? Note that blue schemes belong here.

## Coleman ridge

All versions of p-adic and rigid geometry go here.

"Rigid analysis was created to provide some coherence in an otherwise totally disconnected p-adic realm. Still, it is often left to Frobenius to quell the rebellious outer provinces."

## Algebraic geometry

Think about how to organise this ridge.
- According to different base schemes? C, R, Qp, F_p, W(k), generic char 0 field, generic char p field, ...
- According to different properties, like smooth, projective?
- According to dimension

Use individual mountains, sides of the mountains, colours and features of individual objects. Maybe also music???


## Complex geometry

Topics:
- Complex manifolds
- Riemann surfaces


## Differential geometry

Includes symplectic stuff, or should this go alone?? Think about this and also differential topology, Riemannian geometry, etc.


## Hills of Topology

General topology, Geometric topology, Algebraic topology.

What about homotopy theory? Connect to the Tower of homotopical algebra...

Metric spaces?

## Other geometries

Finite/discrete/metric?/tropical?

## Elementary geometries

Euclidean, spherical, projective, etc.
