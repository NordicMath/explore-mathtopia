# Algebra - reading plan

## Some classical types

This is not an encyclopedic list, but a good selection of the most important classical algebraic structures. Each of these should be studied in some detail (see later files appearing under the Zophie paradigm).

- Monoids
- Finite groups
- Groups

- Rings
- Commutative rings  
- Fields  

- Associative algebras
- Lie algebras
- Hopf algebras  
- Graded algebras
- Differential algebras
- Clifford algebras

- Coalgebras
- Bialgebras
- Lambda-rings

- Posets  
- Lattices
- Boolean algebras  

- Quantum groups

## Modules

Almost all of the structures of the preceeding list have a natural notion of modules.

Example: Fields have vector spaces, rings have modules, groups have representations, lambda-rings have comodules.

There is a general intuitive picture here, where we have a class of "algebra types" containing most of the elements of the above list, and each such type has concrete instances in any (symmetric?) monoidal category, and each concrete instance has an associated category of modules (or sometimes comodules). The above list would have to be cleaned up (I think) for this to be entirely true, but the intuitive picture is important.

We need to talk about frameworks for this picture (modads/comonands, operads, etc). It seems like the language of Feynman categories is stunningly powerful and sorts out the confusion I have felt for the past 10 years or so.

## Algebraic types with extra structure

More complicated algebraic types include:

- Ordered structures, for example ordered fields
