# Algebra overview


In the air:
- The quantum colony
- The Arenas (where algebras and modules train)

On ground, from south to north.
- Fundamental number systems (sea)
- Linear algebra (sea)
- Multilinear algebra
- Finite groups (sea)
- City of Groups

Rings, somehow organised together:
- City of Rings
- Commutative Rings (part of the City?)
- Fields (part of Comm rings?)
- Local rings and fields
- Global rings and fields

More areas, further to the north perhaps, not yet decided:
- Lie algebras
- Associative algebras
- Lambda-rings
- Lattices
- Non-associative algebras
- Monoids and similar structures
- Hopf algebras, near gp schemes and quantum colony

Themes:
- Equations?

Other topics to add:
- Ordered structures???
- Probably much more

In the river, from south to north
- Tower of homological algebra
- Tower of homotopical algebra
- Topological groups
- Real Lie groups
- Complex Lie groups
- Algebraic groups
- Group schemes
- p-adic Lie groups
