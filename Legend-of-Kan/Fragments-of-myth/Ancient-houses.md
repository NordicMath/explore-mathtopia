## Houses

Four houses, with banners! C, R, Qp and polynomials.

R is red like fire
C is cold as ice
Pol is all for power
and Qp on the rise

Clearly, R, C, Qp should be treated on an equal footing, but maybe Pol is somehow essentially different??

It would be pleasant to have one-variable functions in the desert leading to multi-variable functions (near the eastern desert edge) for each of the four main house geometries.
