# Introducing the Legend of Kan project

What is the structure of mathematics? Can we study mathematics as a whole? If I know enough mathematics to know that I want to be a mathematician, how do I get an overview of the entire body of mathematics so that I can get a feeling for what's important and choose where to focus my efforts?

Can we teach students to think of mathematics as a single entity, rather than as a selection of isolated topics? When learning geography, most kids will have access to a globe, giving them a feeling for Earth as a whole, continents, countries, cities etc. Before globes were widely available, they might have been exposed exclusively to the geography of their own home town and its immediate surroundings, and some very important perspectives would be missing in their education. But this is exactly what we tend to do with our students of mathematics, exposing them to only to calculus and a few selected topics in the "immediate surroundings" of calculus (like linear algebra, complex analysis, and Galois theory).

The first time I realized that mathematics can be thought of as a single entity was in the lectures of Lars Svensson at KTH Stockholm, when I was a first-year undergraduate student taking his elective honours classes. In these legendary lectures, we started with linear algebra over general rings and fields (this is unheard of in Sweden) and went on to metric spaces and all kinds of wonders, even briefly touching topos theory and modular forms, all within a single year. Many of the students in those classes went on the be mathematicians. And ever since that time, I have been thinking that it should be possible to write something in the spirit of Lars Svensson, giving an exposition of mathematics as a whole, for the benefit of students everywhere.

The Legend of Kan project, that is now beginning to take form, is an attempt to make this idea a reality. In this introductory note, I want to explain the focus and the philosophy of this project.

The *main challenge* (obviously) is that mathematical literature is huge, and the number of mathematical topics and subareas is enormous. The zbMATH database lists approximately 4 million mathematical documents, and there are also millions of web pages and preprints not listed there. The *solution* that we propose is not to throw out lots and lots of topics, but to employ a set of strategies carefully designed to ease the cognitive burden of the student.

Strategies:
- Structure the exposition around a few central *master themes*.
- Use story-telling with visual and emotional support structures (*Realm of Kan*).
- Organize concepts and their relations with the *Zophie paradigm*.

At this point I probably should confess that my own mathematical interests lie mainly in algebra, number theory and topology, and that my lack of knowledge in analysis, physics and applied mathematics will inevitably skew the presentation.

## Master themes

The master themes that we will attempt to cover are chosen so that a student developing a basic understanding of any one of these themes will have been forced to get in touch with several major frontiers in current research mathematics.

We have a preliminary list of two master themes, and a few more candidates (precise list to be determined).

Master themes:
1. Cohomology theories
2. Zeta functions

Candidates for further master themes:
1. Feynman categories
2. Quantum field theory
3. Geometries
4. Dynamical systems/ergodic theory
5. Partial differential equations

An example illustrating what we mean by a master theme:
- Consider all arxiv math preprints submitted in 2016. There are around 30 000 of them.
- Consider all arxiv math preprints with the word "cohomology" in the abstract submitted in 2016 (call these type A). There are 770 such preprints.
- Consider also all arxiv preprints which contain really deep and truly creative mathematics (call these type B).

Now the claim I want to make is that there is a rather high correlation between type A and type B. Hence if you want to get a good overview of the really deep math preprints posted in 2016 you could skim the the 770 preprints of type A (this takes only a day or two), rather than all 30 000 preprints.

Obviously, using "cohomology" as the only keyword is too blunt a filter, but with a selection of 3 to 8 similar keywords/themes, it should be possible to efficiently catch most of the pearls in the sea of sand.


## The Zophie paradigm

Mathematics is built on a language (group, R-module, manifold, etc etc). The standard paradigm for students learning mathematics is "semantics first", i.e. they are first given the definition of a concept, after which they (slowly!) build up their language around this concept, learning (1) which sentences are admissible and which ones are non-admissible, and (2) which of the admissible sentences are true, and finally (3) why these sentences are true. Roughly, point (1) corresponds to auxiliary definitions, point (2) to theorems, and point (3) to proofs.

Toddlers learning to speak build their skills in a completely different way. Allowing some simplification, we can describe this learning paradigm as "syntax first". They learn that "one, two, three" is an admissible sentence long before they have any semantic understanding of "three". They also tend to learn by incessantly throwing out more or less random sentences, and picking up (from the reaction of people around them) which ones are admissible, and which ones are true (if by "true" we mean the sentences that help them survive).

The toddler paradigm is unbelievably efficient. The Zophie paradigm is an attempt to formalize and develop a similar mode of learning for students of mathematics, mimicking the toddler's approach to language appropriation.

In order to support actual learning under the Zophie paradigm, we as teachers must also take a very unfamiliar approach to feedback. A toddler who says "pillow sleep" as his or her first two-word sentence is amply rewarded with *positive* feedback, even though the sentence is not grammatically correct. A student on the other hand, who formulates a grammatically incorrect sentence, is usually punished, which means we discourage the all-important process of incessant random sentence formation. Ok, maybe "incessant random sentence formation" is not literally what we are after, but the point is that we should *encourage* student to think (and speak!!) about morphisms of schemes long before they master the formal definition of a scheme.

The analogy between a student of mathematics and a toddler is not perfect, but I strongly believe there is something very important at the core of this analogy. Much work is needed though in trying out the Zophie paradigm in actual teaching settings, and maybe in developing a didactical theory supporting it.

Todo: Mention here some sources of inspiration, and related projects. Dieudonn√©, Princeton companion, Rusin atlas, various encyclopedias?

In the philosophy of mathematics, there is important work of Albert Lautman and more recently David Corfield and Fernando Zalamea, emphasizing that philosophers should analyze "real mathematics" rather than the tiny fragments of logic and set theory usually considered. Maybe some of the work developed in the Legend of Kan project could (eventually!) be relevant in such attempts.
