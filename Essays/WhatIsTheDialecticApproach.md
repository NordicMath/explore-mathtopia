# The Dialectic approach

We want to suggest a new approach to thinking about mathematics and training students to think. We call it the Dialectic approach.

This approach is based on a structured collection of questions, that we can ask in the encounter with any type, and other collections of questions that we can ask in encounters with other entities. A first list of "entities" are:

- Types (e.g. "real Hodge structure")
- Topics (e.g. "Hodge theory")

We could also (later) consider the following as entities:

- Mathematicians
- Mathematical documents
- Mathematical events
- Mathematical institutes


## Questions for types

- How can we represent a member of this type?
- How do we translate between different representations?



## Questions for topics  

- Which types of mathematical objects are studied in connection with this topic?
- What are the main references for students wishing to learn this topic?
- Can you give examples of interesting research carried out on this topic in the past X years? (Choose suitable X)
- Which MSC labels are connected with this topic?
- Which journals are best for publishing research on this topic?
