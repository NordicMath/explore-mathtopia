# How to grasp mathematics as a whole

How can you begin to grasp the entire body of mathematics?

How can you create completely new mathematics, beyond the wildest dreams of normal "thinking-within-the-box" mathematicians?

There are some books making attempts in this direction:

- Dieudonn√©: Panorama of Pure Mathematics
- The Princeton companion to mathematics

A very useful tool is the MSC subject classication.
