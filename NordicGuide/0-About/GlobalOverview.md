# The Nordic Guide to Mathematics

The Nordic Guide is a roadmap for ambitious students of mathematics, covering everything from school mathematics to modern research. The roadmap is divided into 7 levels, and under each level we formulate what we believe are the most important learning goals, and collect resources which are helpful for reaching these goals.

The Guide is different from other courses in the following ways:
- We aim for a higher level of understanding than any normal school or university course we are aware of.
- We formulate things in an abstract way (when appropriate) but keep the connection to concrete examples. For example, categories are introduced early.
- We employ a few unusual didactical techniques, such as the Zophie paradigm and the Dialectical approach.

The Nordic Guide is already being tested in mentoring of Norwegian students, and we hope that it can be useful to others as well. If one day this roadmap is developed into a proper online course, we believe it will be the most comprehensive and demanding mathematics course on the planet.


## Level 1: Primary school (ages 1-14)

Overall goal: Be well prepared for excelling in secondary school.

Outline:

1. Develop rudimentary skills in working with
- Numbers
- Algebra
- Geometry
- Combinatorics

2. Develop basic skills in problem-solving (Polya-style)

3. Be exposed to some fragments of the beauty of modern mathematics.


## Level 2: Secondary school (ages 15-18)

Overall goal: Be able to nail the STEP exams used for Cambridge/Oxford admission. (Not because the exams are important in themselves, but because the problems really check whether you have a deeper understanding or not.)

1. Standard number systems:
- The integers
- The rationals
- The reals

2. Sequences

3. Functions
- Different representations of functions
- Important examples of functions
- Calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals, Taylor series)

4. Problems and methods in algebra.
- Simplifying expressions
- Factoring expressions
- Draw sign diagrams for expressions
- Graphing expressions
- Solving equations
- Solving inequalities
- Proving identities
- Proving inequalities

5. Geometry

6. Vectors

7. Combinatorics and probability

8. Some numerical methods

9. Mechanics

10. Problem-solving strategies


## Level 3: Olympiad mathematics

Overall goal: Be able to do well at IMO-level problem-solving.

(This level is designed so that can be skipped, for those students who want to move on to university mathematics earlier.)

1. Problem-solving strategies

2. Geometry

3. Algebra
- Inequalities
- Equations
- Sequences

4. Functional equations

5. Combinatorics

More???

## Level 4: Transition

Overall goal: Have an overview over many of the basic ideas of higher mathematics.

1. Group theory?

2. Examples of research problems?

Think more about this level!!


## Level 5: Undergraduate

Overall goal: Acquire a broad knowledge of the main areas of modern mathematics.

At this point, we focus (more than in a normal undergraduate course) on ideas which are stepping stones to the most exhilarating research frontiers. For example, we cover many different notions of geometry (including sites, simplicial sets, and manifolds), several different examples of cohomology theories, and the theory of L-functions and zeta functions.

Courses:

Geometry 1: Notions of geometry
- Elementary geometries
- Discrete and combinatorial geometries
- Traditional geometries
- Manifold geometries
- Noncommutative geometries
- Algebraic geometries
- Arithmetic geometries  
- Other geometries     

Geometry 2: Manifolds and physics
Include some de Rham cohomology.

Algebra 1: Linear algebra

Algebra 2: Group theory, including representation theory, natural examples of lambda-rings and Hopf algebras, group cohomology, Galois groups, automorphism groups in categories, and maybe connections to geometry (like the classifying space and mapping class groups).

Algebraic geometry 1: Scheme theory  

Foundations 1: Overview of foundational problems
Logic, set theory, type theory, theory of computation, with a selection of interesting topics.

Foundations 2: Category theory
Starting from scratch, covering a little homological and homotopical algebra, and ending with the introduction of Feynman categories, topos theory, and infinity-categories.

Combinatorics 1. Think more about this one.
- Sequences?
- Graphs?

Analysis 1: Functions and function spaces
- Different notions of functions
- Important function spaces

Analysis 2: The study of change
- ODEs
- PDEs
- Dynamical systems

Number theory 1: Zeta functions

Number theory 2: Rational points

Metamathematics 1?

Applied mathematics 1, 2, 3??? (think more about this one). Possible topics include
- Numerical methods for all the standard problems
- Statistics
- Machine learning.
- A panorama of cool applications
- Computational mathematics, algorithms
- Quantum computing? Naah.

Physics 1, 2, ... (think more about this one too).

## Level 6: Graduate

Overall goal: Become an expert in one or a few areas.

The Guide will aim to cover a number of areas in considerable detail, supported by the Zophie paradigm, the Dialectical approach, and the Legend of Kan.

List of planned modules:

- Catalogue of algebraic structures
- Frameworks for algebra (Cover Feynman categories and related notions, including model structures on operads etc etc.)
- Catalogue of geometric structures
- Frameworks for geometry
- Catalogue of cohomology theories
- Frameworks for cohomology
- Category theory
- L-functions and their underlying objects
- Perfectoid things
