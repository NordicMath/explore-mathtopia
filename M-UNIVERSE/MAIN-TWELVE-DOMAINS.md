## REALM OF KAN DOMAINS

The Twelve Domains of the Game:

Separate from the main realm:
- [KU] The Room (maybe change this to a Castle?)
- [TR] The Tunnel

Underground (vertical level 1):
- [FO] The Dark Halls of Foundations

Ground level (vertical level 2), from west to east:
- [AL] The Fertile Plains of Algebra
- [GE] The Great Mountains of Geometry
- [DE] The Desert of Differential Equations
- [AP] The Endless Mines of Applied Mathematics

In the air (vertical level 3):
- [ZF] The Kingdom-in-the-skies of Zeta Functions
- [CT] The Bridges of Cohomology

In outer space (vertical level 4):
- [PH] The Vast Expanse of Physics

Not yet positioned, but probably on ground level:
- [ME] The Temples (five temples for the Educators, the Historians, the Linguists, the Philosophers, and the Librarians)
- [CO] Combinatorics (Island? Caves???)

Story:

On the top of a hill, in an old castle, we find the world of basic mathematics. Some of the artifacts are useful and interesting, but it is a grey castle, and we are confined within its walls.

In the castle there is a magic wardrobe, leading to a tunnel with a path to an unknown land. This path is where we find the first steps of abstract mathematics, the "rite of passage" for travellers brave enough to enter... the Realm of Kan.

Whoever makes it through the tunnel, appears on an southern island, surveying the sea and beyond it, a magical land of infinite extent. The land is split by a large river.

On the west bank of the river, the Fertile Plains of Algebra extend, green and lush, with flourishing cities and small quiet villages.

East of the river, the Great Mountains of Geometry rise, towering over the river.

East of the Mountains: the Dry Desert of Differential Equations.

Far East, we find the Endless Mines of Applied Mathematics (and beyond it only impenetrable jungle).

Deep beneath the Earth: the Dark Halls of Foundations.

In the clouds: The Kingdom-in-the-skies of Zeta Functions.

Above the clouds: The Vast Expanse of Mathematical Physics.

Above the river, the Bridges of Cohomology.

Island of Combinatorics.

Temples of Sages.

We could also add the Jungle as a 13th domain, where the jungle would symbolize all the mathematics yet to be discovered.
