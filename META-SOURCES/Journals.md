# Journals

Journals can be organised by any of the following:

- By topic
- By how "good" they are
- By publisher

Organising by topic is very impractical (many journals cover all of pure math) so I will organise by publisher, but add a "rating" from A (top) to F (bottom), to indicate my suggested reading priority.

A: Top top journal, first prio
B: Top journal
C: Really good
D: Solid
E: Not great, but may contain some diamonds
F: Trash
