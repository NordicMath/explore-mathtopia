# Finite games

A key component of the tunnel is a sequence of "finite games"

A finite game is a well-defined and finite task that involves some element of abstract mathematics. The point is that playing these games is both an introduction to some area of mathematics, and training in thinking like a mathematician.

- Compute with permutations in cycle notation
- Compute with roots of unity, for example cyclotomic polynomials or Dirichlet characters.
- Compute in Z/m
- Compute in finite fields
- Something with Young diagrams/tableaux/partitions
- Something with decimals
- Continued fractions
- Matrices
- Barycentric coordinates
- Polyhedra and Euler characteristics
- Graphs
- Need to think about what to do in analysis. Vector spaces, polynomials, differentiation, integration?
