## DE Overview

- Special visuals somewhere for differentiation and integration
- Somewhere: Foundations and different versions of diff and int.

Function theory, either close to the sea, but probably better close to their respective geometries.
- Real functions?
- Complex functions?
- Multivariable real functions?
- Multivariable complex functions? Hmm, one could argue that complex functions should be close to complex geometry...
- p-adic analysis
- Polynomials and rational functions

Near the eastern edge somewhere:
- Garden of ODEs
- Garden of PDEs


In the western part of the desert, near the Mountains, from south to north:
- Topological vector spaces, with Banach and Hilbert as special subclasses
- Arenas for topological algebras?
- Global analysis (near diff geom)
- p-adic analysis, near Coleman ridge

In the eastern parts perhaps, or in the middle, just a preliminary list of areas to add:
- Operator theory, subsumes Spectral theory (and should perhaps go close to non-comm geom)
- Potential theory (close to complex variables, to probability, and to TVSs)
- Harmonic analysis 
- Integral transforms (goes between ODEs and Operator theory)

Finally, to the north, near the eastern border:
- Probability
