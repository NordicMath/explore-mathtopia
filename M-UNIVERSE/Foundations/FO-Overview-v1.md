# Halls of Foundations

Three halls are located under their respective superstructures:

- Foundations of Algebra (monads/comonads/operads etc, universal algebra)
- Foundations of Geometry (abstract sheaf theory, Erlangen program?, synthetic diff geom?????)
- Foundations of Analysis (non-standard?)

Here is a first attempt at subdividing foundations into Halls:

- Sets
- Types
- Categories
- Higher categories
- Logics (?)
- Model theory
- Recursion theory
- Proof theory
- Intelligent Computer Mathematics

Note: Philosophy (including constructive mathematics) has been placed in a Temple.
