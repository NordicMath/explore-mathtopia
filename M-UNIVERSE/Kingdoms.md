In an ordinary house, in an ordinary room, we find the world of school mathematics. Some of the artifacts are useful and interesting, but it is a grey room, and we are confined within its walls.

In a magic wardrobe there is a path to a mysterious land. This path is where we find the first steps in abstract mathematics, the "rite of passage" for travellers brave enough to enter.
