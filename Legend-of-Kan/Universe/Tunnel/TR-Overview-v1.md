# The Tunnel of Transition

The tunnel takes the brave adventurer from the exciting but limited world of school mathematics to the Realm of Kan.

Inside the tunnel we find

- A sequence of finite games
- Some form of training in proofs
- Basic set theory
- Basic type theory
- Problem-solving strategies
- A taste of physics, like a proof of Kepler's laws, or the physics solution of the Basel problem.

When exiting the tunnel, the Beach of Recreational Mathematics awaits. We view this as part of the tunnel (for organisational purposes in the game). The traveller may choose whether to stay on the beach or take the ferry over to the Mainland.
