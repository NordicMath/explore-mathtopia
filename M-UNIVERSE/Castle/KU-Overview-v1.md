# Castle overview

"KU" stands for "from Kindergarten to University".

We imagine all the mathematics you learn in school, from basic counting to the beginnings of calculus, as being placed in an ancient mind castle on a hill. Moving around inside this castle takes us to different parts of school mathematics.
