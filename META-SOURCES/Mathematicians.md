# Mathematicians

Goal: List of mathematicians worth reading.

There are several ways of finding these mathematicians:

- Historical sources
- Lists of [award recipients:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics_awards)
- Search by geographical location, e.g. MIT people.
- Personal choice, especially young people whose work we like

### Old masters
- Euler; [Euler archive](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/)
- Gauss
- Abel
- Kronecker
- Hilbert


### Fields medal
- Faltings


### Abel prize
- Serre

### Various
- John Voight; [Web](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~jvoight/research.html)
- Denis-Charles Cisinski

### Quora Fields medal candidates discussion

Jacob Tsimerman, number theory : likelihood 5%

Lexing Ying, numerical analysis and scientific computing : likelihood 5%

Peter Scholze, Simon Brendle and Ciprian Manolescu have already been mentioned here. Let me mention two names which are not appearing in any such list (and I am surprised by that).

    Geordie Williamson He will be 39 year old in 2018, so is eligible for the award. He has won the EMS prize, New Horizon Prize, Chevalley Prize, a Clay Research Award (just to name a few). He has done some extraordinary work on Geometric Representation Theory, in particular on something called Soergel Bimodules and has publications in some of the “top” journals. He is also a Plenary Speaker at the ICM next year (he and Scholze are the only Plenary Speaker below the age of 40 ! ).
    Hugo Duminil-Copin He will be 33 in 2018 and he already is a Permanent Professor at the IHES, France. He has also won the EMS prize, New Horizon Prize, Rollo Davidson Prize (Wendellin Werner, anothe Fields Medallist got this award), Oberwolfach Prize etc. (again just to name a few). He works on Statistical Physics, Probability Theory and related areas. Given the fact that Smirnov, Villani, Werner etc. have been awarded the Fields Medal while working in similar type of areas strengthen the belied that he might be a contender. He is also an Invited Speaker at the ICM 2018. Moreover, his advisor was Stanislav Smirnov, another Fields Medallist.
