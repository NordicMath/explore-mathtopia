# Armies of Algebra

Prophesy has foretold that one day, the evil overlords of the Mines will go to war against the West, in order to destroy all the mathematics that does not have an obvious and immediate "impact" on economic growth. Number theorists will be enslaved and forced to work out Iwasawa theory for the prime p=2, and geometers will be forced to solve geometry olympiad problems using only the method of cartesian coordinates.

In order to fight back and avoid this disaster, the forces of Algebra and Geometry are preparing their defences.

The armies of Algebra are organised into at least four types of "warriors".

1. The "Generals". These are: Monads (male), comonads (female), and operads (genderless, and fighting mainly by their unbearably sorrowful singing).

2. Each general commands "Officers", which are their algebras/coalgebras.

3. Each officer commands "Foot soldiers", usually called its modules.

4. Powerful half-gods called "Categories" do not normally take on physical form and fight, but they live in the land as invisible spirits, protecting and upholding the fundamental order of the realm. In times of crisis however, they may appear in physical form, usually as a large animal.

The most important class of categories (for war purposes) are the Symmetric monoidal ones. When in physical form, they appear as dragons (?).

The Arenas are floating platforms designed for training. On these platforms different algebras and modules may engage in sparring and sometimes even some real fighting.

There are legends concerning the origin of officers...
