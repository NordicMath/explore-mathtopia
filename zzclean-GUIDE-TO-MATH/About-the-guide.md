# The NordicMath Guide to Mathematics

Aim: Design the best course on mathematics ever created, from counting to proving the Riemann hypothesis.

## Primary

Goals:
- Basic understanding of numbers
- Basic skills in algebra
- Experience of problem-solving

## Secondary

Goals:
- Competence on the level of the STEP tests

## Olympiad

Goals:
- Competence on the level of IMO problems

## Transition

Goals:
- Skills in different modes of higher mathematical thinking
- First exposure to all the main areas of modern mathematics

## Undergraduate

Here the plan is to design courses that would give a deeper understanding of mathematics than any currently existing course.

Sketch of course plan (connect to Realm of Kan):
- Algebra I: Finite groups
- Analysis I: Functions
- Number theory I: L-functions
- Number theory II: Solving equations
- More courses: Geometry (up to singular/de Rham cohom/periods?), categories, applied stuff?


## Research transition

- Metamathematics: Notation, what is good research, etc?
- Systematic overview of all math, with Kan and Zophie integration.


### Undergrad course example: Algebra I
- Finite groups: Basic theory.
- Representations of finite groups, including character tables, stuff from Wushi's course and the symmetric groups.
- Representation rings of finite groups; lambda-rings.
- The group ring of a finite group; Hopf algebras.
- The general representation theory problem: Describe all R-modules. Ref Etingof.
- Categories: Tensor categories and related notions.
- Hints of monads/comonads/Feynman cats.

Extra topics could include Galois theory, classifying spaces, and more general types of groups including algebraic groups.
