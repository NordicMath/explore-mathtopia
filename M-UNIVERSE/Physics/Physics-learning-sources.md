# How one could maybe learn physics

## Introduction

Although one can do a lot of mathematics [without knowing any physics](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/74642/if-i-want-to-study-jacob-luries-books-higher-topoi-theory-derived-ag-what), such knowledge still opens up some amazing windows.

Some people even seem to believe that infinity-categories will play a crucial role in some form of unified theory of everything, and number theory seems to have a large number of connections to physics as well. Maybe even more importantly, physical intuition can guide the development of new mathematics (examples: enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry).

## Learning physics from scratch

I believe the best starting point is the courses of Susskind.
