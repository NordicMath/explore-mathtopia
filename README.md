# The SYNTH project

The SYNTH project aims to address a number of fundamental challenges in the interface between research mathematics and computer science.

The word SYNTH was chosen with several associations in mind:
- "A new synthesis of mathematics?"
- Zalamea's Synthetic philosophy of mathematics
- Semantic Yoga of Number THeory  
- The image of mathematics as a incredibly rich and beautiful symphony, (which could perhaps be composed using a synthesizer).


### Goals
We work towards the following inter-connected goals:
- Develop frameworks for understanding the global structure of mathematics.
- Develop new approaches to teaching high-level mathematics
- Build computer programs doing high-level automated mathematics in various forms
- Do and publish conventional mathematical research


## Description

More details/some background.

SYNTH has a series of inter-connected subprojects:
- The Nordic Guide to Mathematics. An online guide to all aspects of mathematics, aimed at serious students.
- The Legend of Kan project. A fantasy world where mathematics can be structured and visualized.
- The Nordic Library of Mathematics. A guide to the mathematical literature.
- Zophie. An AI general mathematician, based on the Zophie paradigm and the Dialectic approach.
- Arnold. A AI number theorist, including a semantic database of multiplicative functions and methods for doing automated research.
- More??

Refer to the folder About-SYNTH for more details.


### Collaborators

The SYNTH project was initiated by Andreas Holmstrom and Torstein Vik as part of the NordicMath collaboration.

For the Arnold project, we collaborate with the research group of Michael Kohlhase and Florian Rabe (link).

For some of our number theory projects, we work together with Magnus Hellebust Haaland and Olav Hellebust Haaland.

Other students who have been or are currently involved:
- Ane Espeseth
- Alex Makassiouk
- Preben Hast SÃ¸rli
