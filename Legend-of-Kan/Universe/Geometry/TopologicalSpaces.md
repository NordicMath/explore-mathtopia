# Mountain of Topology

There are many different approaches to define what we mean by an "abstract space". The Mountain of Topology (the first of six(?) in the Southern Ridge) has four sides.

The west side (where travellers from the river would arrive) is home to the traditional "point-set" approaches.

The east side (facing towards the Riemannian world) is home to the "distance" approaches.

The south side is where the combinatorial approaches are found.

The north side (facing towards the regions of algebraic geometry) could be the open sets approaches (locales, sites).

## East side (point-set)

Most important categories:
- Top  
- CGHaus


## South side (combinatorial)

### CW complexes

Recall somewhere the YT talk of Lior(?).

### Simplicial sets

Explain test categories.

### Simplicial complexes

[Knill survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08211)


## West side (metric)

Metric spaces, but explain also all the other variations, like pseudometric, ultrametric, uniform, approach, etc.

## North side (opens)

- Locales  
- Sites
