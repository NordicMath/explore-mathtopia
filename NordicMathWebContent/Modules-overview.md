# Modules

Plan for NordicMath Academy:
- A complete guide to mathematics for the ambitious student.
- All material collected on a webpage.
- Divide the material into modules.
- Each module is something like a one-week course, with core material, optional material, a "Looking forward" section, exercises, core problems, and optional problems.

Use the material for Matematikk X 2018/2019 as a test run.

We should have four master levels I think, something like school/basic, olympiad mathematics, undergrad/transition, and grad/higher.

Now to the modules for School:

- Preparatory material (inspiration for younger students)



-
- Integers
- Rational numbers
- Real numbers
- Complex numbers
- Finite number systems
- Mathematical language (functions, relations, etc)
