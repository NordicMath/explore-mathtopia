## MATHTOPIA KINGDOMS

The Ten Domains of the Game:

- The Room
- The Tunnel
- The Dark Halls of Foundations
- The Endless Mines of Applied Mathematics
- The Fertile Plains of Algebra
- The Great Mountains of Geometry
- The Desert of Differential Equations
- The Kingdom-in-the-skies of Zeta Functions
- The Vast Expanse of Physics
- The Bridges of Cohomology

In an ordinary house, in an ordinary room, we find the world of basic mathematics. Some of the artifacts are useful and interesting, but it is a grey room, and we are confined within its walls.

In the room there is a magic wardrobe, leading to a tunnel with a path to an unknown land. This path is where we find the first steps of abstract mathematics, the "rite of passage" for travellers brave enough to enter... Mathtopia.

Whoever makes it through the tunnel, sees a magical land of infinite extent. The land is split by a large river.

On the west bank of the river, the Fertile Plains of Algebra extend, green and lush, with flourishing cities and small quiet villages.

East of the river, the Great Mountains of Geometry rise, towering over the river.

To the west of the Fertile Plains, we find the Endless Mines of Applied Mathematics.

Far east, beyond the Mountains: the Dry Desert of Differential Equations.

Deep beneath the Earth: the Dark Halls of Foundations.

In the clouds: The Kingdom-in-the-skies of Zeta Functions.

Above the clouds: The Vast Expanse of Mathematical Physics.

Above the river, the Bridges of Cohomology.
