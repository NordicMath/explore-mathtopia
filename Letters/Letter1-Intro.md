# Letter no. 1: Introduction and goals  

Hi :-)

We have talked for some time about a more structured approach to learning. We have tried emailing, we have tried meeting regularly to discuss commutative algebra, and we have mostly failed, maybe because of our respective time constraints and me just generally being busy.

Now that you are leaving school, I have some ideas about how to proceed in a more structured way, and these letters will be (I hope!!) a way to make these ideas a reality.

This first letter is an introduction where I spell out my plan, and you can tell me whether this sounds like a good plan or not.

In my head, the ultimate short-term goal is that four years or so from now, you will be better prepared to start a PhD than any beginning graduate student I have ever met, while I will have reviewed all of the mathematics I know and learnt a lot more. The long-term goal (10 to 20 years) is to develop a body of teaching materials that will be useful for other students of mathematics in the future.

I will employ a number of didactical approaches that are quite unusual, but if you have been happy with my teaching so far, I hope you can also trust that these approaches will be helpful! Here is what I'm thinking:

- Honesty: I will be honest about what I understand and what I don't understand, and I will be honest about what I think is interesting and not.
- Universality: I believe in studying mathematics as a whole, and I will try to teach you mathematics, not a specific subdomain of mathematics. Ideally, this should include mathematical physics and theoretical computer science too.
- Attitude: I choose to believe that I (and you) can learn anything we want within the domain of mathematics.
- The Legend of Kan paradigm: I believe it is helpful to communicate my internal view of the landscape of mathematics, and the Legend of Kan project is set up to do precisely that. Note that any other mathematician will have a different view though, and I'm not claiming that my priorities and my focus are in any way "the best". However, I also believe that we are quite similar in how we think about stuff, which hopefully means that my internal views will make sense to you.
- The Zophie paradigm: I believe you should learn to talk about concepts before you know the formal definitions, just like any toddler learning to speak about everyday objects. The formal foundation for this approach is the Zophie paradigm of (1) "naive dependent types", (2) the four fundamental machine types, and (3) machines in more generality.
- Master concepts: I believe in using "master concepts" as starting points, which are super-central ideas connected to and underlying many other mathematical concepts. Examples of such master concepts are "cohomology", "zeta types", and "Feynman categories".
- Fundamental questions: I also believe in trying to identify the fundamental questions we as mathematicians are trying to answer. Without such questions as a guide, it is perfectly possible to get bogged down in some tiny details and be stuck there for the rest of your life.

As for prerequisites (in case someone else is also reading this), I will assume that you know the basics of abstract algebra (i.e. some familiarity with groups, rings, fields, modules and vector spaces), the basics of topology (i.e. some familiarity with metric and topological spaces) and the basics of category theory (categories, functors, natural transformations, limits, colimits, adjoints, the idea of an abelian category). But even some of these ideas might be reviewed again as we begin the study of each of these areas.

Ok, I think we're good to go!
