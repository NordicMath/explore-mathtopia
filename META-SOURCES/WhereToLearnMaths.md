# Where to learn mathematics


- Books (electronic)
- Books (on paper)
- Journals
- Preprint repositories
- Private webpages
- Encyclopedias


- Collected works of great mathematicians
Springer Collected Works, some AMS volumes, Quillen, Arthur, Serre online, ...

- Blogs

- MathOverflow


- Lectures
- Private conversations with teachers/experts


## Blogs

## Targeted and systematic arxiv searches

Add Langlands and motivic here above.

## Journals

Todo: List top journals here.

The point of reading journals rather than arxiv is that you only get top quality material. The advantage of arxiv is that you get the most recent articles.

### Journal providers


Just a starting point, this is very incomplete:

https://eudml.org/journals

http://www.jstor.org/subject/mathematics

http://www.numdam.org/

https://www.springer.com/gp/mathematics




## Book series

One way of surveying the textbook literature is to read through the list of titles in the best book series.

Note that if your university has access to SpringerLink, all the Springer books can be read online!

It seems like some CUP books also are available under subscription.

For other books, finding them online requires some more searching, and sometimes they are not available at all.
