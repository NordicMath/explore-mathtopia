# Halls of Foundations

Currently, we have 6+6+3 halls in total:

- Six halls to follow MSC
- Six halls designed by you and me
- Three halls to build the world we see

Three halls are located under their respective superstructures.

- Foundations of Algebra (monads/comonads/operads etc, universal algebra)
- Foundations of Geometry (abstract sheaf theory, Erlangen program?, synthetic diff geom?????)
- Foundations of Analysis (non-standard models, Weierstrass example)

In addition, we have these halls:

- Logics (03Bxx)
- Model theory (03Cxx)
- Computability and recursion (03Dxx)
- Sets (03Exx)
- Proof theory (03Fxx)
- Algebraic logic (03Gxx)
- Categorical logic
- Type theory
- Intelligent Computer Mathematics
- General category theory
- Special kinds of categories
- Higher categories


There are connections (tunnels) including:
- From model theory to number theory
- From algebraic logic to Boolean algebras and lattices


## Key concepts

Some can be found in the [MSC classication page for 03-XX](https://mathscinet.ams.org/msc/msc2010.html?t=03-XX)


## Reading list:

### General for Foundations:
- Manin?
- Toposes, triples, theories?
