# The Legend of Kan: Prelude

## Grasping mathematics as a whole

You are young, and you're in love with mathematics. You have experienced the thrill of solving super-hard problems, and you have glimpsed the stunning beauty of abstract mathematics. Now you want to learn more, maybe study for years, become an expert, live and breathe mathematics for rest of your life.

The problem is - where do you start? In the old days this was easier. The only source of mathematics might have been the local library, or a friendly adult with some mathematical knowledge and a few books to lend you. It was often possible to read more or less everything you could get your hands on. Today, the zbMATH database lists approximately 4 000 000 published mathematical documents (many of which you can now read online), and in addition there are millions of webpages of varying quality.

How can you begin to grasp the entire body of mathematics? And how should you prepare if you dream of one day creating completely new mathematics, maybe beyond the wildest dreams of our generation, given that we so often find ourselves thinking within the box?

## Trying to get an overview

There are some books making attempts in the direction of giving an overview of mathematics. Three of the best books that come to mind are Dieudonn√©: A Panorama of Pure Mathematics (1982), The Princeton companion to mathematics (2008), and The Princeton companion to applied mathematics (2015).

Another useful tool is the MSC subject classification, which subdivides mathematics into areas and subareas.

When the Internet was young, there were essentially only two interesting web pages. One was Dave Rusin's The Mathematical Atlas, which now appears to have disappeared, although you can find a copy thanks to the Wayback Machine. The other was Eric Weissteins MathWorld.

Finally, let me advertise Fernando Zalamea's book Synthetic Philosophy of Contemporary Mathematics, a most marvellous attempt at understanding and explaining the essence of real mathematics, including the creative process of today's greatest minds.

## Habits for organising mathematics inside your own head

What goes on inside the minds of Hilbert, von Neumann, Grothendieck, or one of today's great mathematicians with seemingly encyclopedic knowledge, like Deligne or Kontsevich? Are there habits of thinking that we can learn, that will help us remember and understand large and interconnected oceans of mathematical knowledge?

I don't know if it is possible to teach these skills. Maybe each one of us has to find his or her own path. Still I'd like to say a few things I would have liked to hear when I was younger.

Given a mathematical topic or a concept, a good habit is to always ask:
- Why is this interesting?
- What are the fundamental problems in this area?
- What are the fundamental problems that this concept helps us solve?

To begin with, we may ask: What are the fundamental problems of mathematics?

My opinion is that THE most fundamental problem is "What is geometry?". We have elaborate geometric frameworks, (metric spaces, manifolds, schemes, etc etc) but we have no idea what the fundamental geometry of the universe is (quantum gravity) nor do we have any idea what the fundamental geometry underlying the prime numbers looks like (F1-geometry). There is also a constant stream of new geometric frameworks being developed (recent examples include Neumaier's "coherent spaces" and Haran's new F1-geometry based on "generalised rings") and somewhere, one day, quantum gravity and the Riemann hypothesis may be solved by a person finding a new and splendid notion of geometry.

Some other fundamental problems of mathematics are:
- "What is a number? What is symmetry?" (this leads to much of algebra as we know it)
- "What is truth?" (leads to logic)
- "How do quantities in nature change with time? How do quantities in nature relate to each other?" (leads to analysis)
- "How can we make decisions with incomplete information?" (leads to probability)
- "How do we build machines to kill other animals and move up the dominance hierarchy?" (leads to applied mathematics)

## More advice

We are all different (maybe with the exception of myself), and you should always follow your own intuition above the advice of previous generations. Still, here are a few pieces of warning and encouragement.

1. Read paper books, not just webpages.
2. Work hard and be focussed
3. Be open to other modes of thinking. Don't reject physics just because it's incomprehensible, don't reject category theory just because it's abstract, and so on.
4. Take care of your own physical and mental health.

From the Wikipedia page on Ramanujan: "He received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, but was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process. [...] Without a FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation."

## The Legend of Kan

The human mind is designed for survival and reproduction, and this means that we have an intuitive understanding of things like food, violence, death, colours, sounds, stories, anthropomorphism, time, physical movement, social relations, emotions, music, and exploration of unknown territory. On the other hand, we are not designed to parse long strings containing lots of logical quantifiers or to remember arbitrary sign conventions. Successful computer games and fantasy literature tend to exploit these design features of the human mind. Think of Minecraft, World of Warcraft, or Tolkien's Middle-earth.

The project I would like to introduce with this note is called "The Legend of Kan" (from the quote "Every concept is a Kan extension"). It is a world in which the inhabitants of the mathematical universe come alive. Maybe a visit to the Realm of Kan will help you find your own path, so that you, or your students after you, one day can find the geometries that our generation could not reach.

(Let me state here for the record that applied mathematics can also be used for benevolent purposes, and if your path in life should lead you to the Endless Mines, I hope that you will use your skills responsibly.)
