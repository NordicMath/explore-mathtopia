### Scattered notes

Strive to view math more like life, for example like physics or like action or without foundation. Maybe this is one obstacle to math AI, i.e. programming this intuition? Beauty?

Other math thought frameworks are
- Stories of any kind
- Death
- Emotions
- Music
- Colors
- Personalities, anthropomorph??
- Time, e.g. in composing functors

Avoid static content description, but if you do have it, think of it as a landscape, i.e. a long proof as a system of rivers and tributaries, or mathematics as a whole as the world of Tolkien...

Compare math concepts to irreducible existential notions, to illustrate the point that maybe it is good to allow for things to simply be what they are, and talk about them
