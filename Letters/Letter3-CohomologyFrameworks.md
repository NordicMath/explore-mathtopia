# Frameworks for cohomology

Cohomology theories touch on almost all interesting subareas of algebra, number theory, geometry and topology, and there are interesting connections also to physics, analysis and of course category theory. Getting an overview of cohomology seems like a reasonably efficient way to get a first overview also over these parts of mathematics.

The study of different cohomology theories can be organized by several different frameworks. Maybe all of these fit into some super-master-framework that I am not aware of, but to begin with we'll start with a few partial frameworks.

Why is cohomology so important? I think a general answer is that virtually every interesting invariant of geometric objects of some kind have turned out to be a special case of some cohomology theory.


## Things to accept

Hierarchy of theories:
- Ordinary (Ga)
- K-theoretic (Gm)
- Higher oriented
- Non-oriented
- Unstable???



Extra structure on target category.

Examples: Galois action. Hodge structure. Gerstenhaber structure on HH? Module over the Steenrod algebra on ordinary cohom?

Is it true that geometric theories tend to land in representations (Tannakian setting), while absolute theories are modules over some fixed algebra?

## The stable homotopy category

Spectra and cohomology of topological spaces.

## Grothendieck constructions

A site with a sheaf has cohomology. Same if we have a site with a complex of sheaves (or a sheaf of complexes, same thing?). And a site with a sheaf of spectra? And a simplicial site (????) with a sheaf of spectra.

Also recall Thomason's construction of THH (I think?) for schemes?

An important point is that some cohomology theories are just cohomology of some special sheaf or of some special class of spaces.

## Six functors and the big fat family

Relative, local, compact support etc.


## The non-commutative motives framework of Tabuada.

Notes from conversation with Kristian: A good way of viewing the "noncommutative motives" invariants may be to see them as invariants factoring through the category of stable infinity-categories. Many objects give rise to a stable infinity-category (rings give the cat of perfect complexes, for example) and we can take K-theory or THH etc of any stable infinity-category.

An example that does not fit into this framework: Waldhausen K-theory of the category of finite sets with bijections. The construction here involved a symmetric monoidal groupoid, its nerve, and maybe something more.



## Operadic cohomology theories

Ref: Thesis of Ward. These theories include:
- Hochschild cohomology of an A-infinity or associative algebra.
- Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of an L-infinity or Lie algebra.
- Harrison cohomology of a commutative algebra.
- Leibniz cohomology
- Poisson cohomology

Ref: Ward's thesis pp. 26.

In these examples, H^1 classifies infinitesimal deformations, and H^2 is the obstruction to extending to a formal deformation.


## Collecting stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere

Morse homology?

Point counting?

## Stuff to think about and sort

Automorphic cohomology

Foliated cohomology
