# The remarkable unity of mathematics

Some people seem to think of mathematics as a tree, first branching into geometry, algebra and analysis, then further branching geometry into topology, differential geometry, algebraic geometry, etc, continuing in this fashion until you reach the finest and most specialized topics. The MSC classification is based on such a picture.

However, I want to argue that this picture is fundamentally flawed, and that we should not aim to become good algebraic geometers, or good number theorists, but to become good mathematicians, trying to learn mathematics as a whole.

In this post I want to simply list a few examples of books, articles, and topics to really drive home the point that even if you find category theory and algebraic geometry most interesting, it's crucial to also learn some combinatorics and partial differential equations.
