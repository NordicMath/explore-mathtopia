HH is a Gerstenhaber algebra I think?


A talk abstract from the MAGIC seminar: Andrei Negu»õ (MIT): Certain geometric Hall algebras and their categorification
A classical result of Nakajima and Grojnowski says that the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg algebra acts on the cohomology groups of Hilbert schemes on smooth projective surfaces. In this talk I'll generalize this result: from the Heisenberg algebra to the elliptic Hall algebra, from cohomology to derived categories and from Hilbert schemes to smooth moduli spaces of stable sheaves. Doing these generalizations requires completely new technology, and I'll point out some of the interesting geometric objects that arise.
