# The Dialectic approach

We want to suggest a new approach to thinking about mathematics and training students to think. We call it the Dialectic approach.

This approach is based on a structured collection of questions, that we can ask in the encounter with any type, and other collections of questions that we can ask in encounters with other entities. A first list of "entities" are:

- Types
- Subareas of mathematics
- Mathematicians


## Questions for types

- How can we represent a member of this type?
- How do we translate between different representations?
