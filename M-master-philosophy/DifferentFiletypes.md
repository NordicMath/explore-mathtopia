# File types

In order to structure the vast number of files, it might be helpful to establish some conventions. This is a first sketch only.

S: Synopsis files: These can be used with students to quickly cover various topics/courses.

Z: Zophie paradigm files: Contains a type, for example finite group, and various machines related to that type.

Remark: S and Z files are similar, but S files are less formal (and could be formalized later).

K: Legend of Kan files: Contains stories of fantasy, placing various topics in the Realm of Kan landscape.

R: Reading plan files: Contains reading plan for Nordic Math study groups.

B: Blurb (i.e. a short description of a book, film, or other product written for promotional purposes). The idea can later be incorporated in a more formal environment.
